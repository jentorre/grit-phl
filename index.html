  			<li>WhatsApp <br>
  				<p>WhatsApp Messenger is a freeware, cross-platform and end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application for smartphones.[10] It uses the Internet to make voice calls, one to one video calls; send text messages, images, GIF, videos, documents, user location, audio files, phone contacts and voice notes[11][12] to other users using standard cellular mobile numbers. It also incorporates a feature called Status, which allows users to upload photos and videos to a 24-hours-lifetime feed that, by default, are visible to all contacts; similar to Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram Stories.<p><br>

  			<li>Snapchat <br>
  				<p>Snapchat is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown,[6] former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal concepts of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are only available for a short time before they become inaccessible. The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as "Picaboo", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction.<p><br>

  			<li>Instagram <br>
  				<p>Instagram lets registered users upload photos or videos to the service. Users can apply various digital filters to their images, and add locations through geotags. They can add hashtags to their posts, linking the photos up to other content on Instagram featuring the same subject or overall topic. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social media profiles, enabling them to share photos to those profiles as well. Originally, a distinctive feature of Instagram was its confining of photos to a square, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid SX-70 images. This was changed in August 2015, when an update started allowing users to upload media at full size.</p><br>

  			<li>Musical.ly <br>
  				<p>Musical.ly is a video social network app for video creation, messaging, and live broadcasting. The first prototype was released in April 2014, and the official version was launched in August of that year. Through the app, users can create 15-second to 1 minute videos and choose sound tracks to accompany them, use different speed options (time-lapse, slow, normal, fast, and epic) and add pre-set filters and effects. The app also allows users to browse popular "musers," content, trending songs and sounds and hashtags. As of July 2016, musical.ly has over 90 million registered users and an average of 12 million new videos posted every day.[2] musical.ly is headquartered in Shanghai, China and has offices in San Francisco, California.[3]</p><br>
